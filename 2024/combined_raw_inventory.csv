UNCW had updated the old SUN2Wave from an ADCP w/ NEMO to report waves and currents with the Nexsens Wave Buoy on 11/7/2019.  The NEMO was no longer being supported by Teledyne so a new solution for acquisition of wave data was implemented. This station was given a CMAN station number by NDBC in error.
