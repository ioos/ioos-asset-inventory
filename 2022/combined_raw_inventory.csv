Having two gauges is typical practice for long term stations so there is redundancy in the observations in order to reduce the potential for data gaps.Despite this redundancy, Dillingham is an extremely challenging site since the dock goes dry, making data gaps still likely and expected, even with redundant technologies. Gauge 1 is a bubbler system secured to the seawall. It goes dry during spring tides, and also can freeze-up during winter. Gauge 2, is a downward looking radar that is co-located with Gauge 1, and also secured to the seawall.
